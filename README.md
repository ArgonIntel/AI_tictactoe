# AI_tictactoe

Implementation of a Minimax algorithm into the logic of Tic Tac Toe game.

This was one of the assignment projects in the Harvard course CS50 Artificial Intelligence.

The runner.py file was provided as a starting point while the students had to develop the
tictactoe.py with a logic of the game.

It is quite a small project but I am very proud that I was able to make it work.
